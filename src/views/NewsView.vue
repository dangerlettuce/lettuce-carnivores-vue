    <p>No, you don't need a coupon code. 
      <span class="tooltip">
        Here's why
        <span class="tooltiptext">
          We think coupon codes are annoying and anti-consumer. Sure, a 'New Customer' code might attract new customers, but then your loyal customers are missing out. A 'Returning Customer' code solves that, but at that point it's just adding annoying steps for everyone. Worse, some will only discover that there was a new/returning coupon code after their purchase, which really feels bad. 
          
          Instead, we automatically apply promotions to your cart and tell you how to qualify right on the shopping cart page. We want to attract new customers with our wide selection of high quality plants and reasonable prices. Want you to return because you had a great experience, or because you were satisfied with the outcome of whatever situation didn't go perfectly. 
          
          Simple and fair seems like a win for all of us.
